# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# tranDCT inter-coefficients dependencies analysis script
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# this is a sample .tds file explaining how it works
# comments are written after '#'
# first line of the file must be '<TDAS>'


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# the following (in [] brackets) are general settings
# they can be anywhere in the file, for convenience they are right here on top of the file
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# uncomment if a generic gnuplot .plt file accompanying the .csv file should also be written

# [wrt_gplt]


# 'missing' lines are lines where one or more values are not available due to image borders
# uncomment the following to also include these lines in the .csv

# [inc_incp]


# if 'missing' lines should be commented out with '#' in the .csv uncomment the following
# of course, this only makes sense, if '[inc_incp]' (see above) is active

# [cmt_incp]


# if a checklist showing which lines are 'missing' should be included uncomment this
# the checklist appears as last column in the .csv - 0 means 'missing', 1 means complete
# again, there is only sense in this if '[inc_incp]' (see above) is active

# [inc_chkl]


# uncomment this if a description of each row in the table should be included
# descriptions are included as first column

# [inc_desc]


# uncomment if names of columns should be included as well
# this makes only sense if names are defined for each column below

# [inc_name]


# uncomment if lengths of each column should be checked and compared with each other
# in general each column should have same length, otherwise there might be something wrong

# [chk_ssiz]


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# here rules for generation of each column are defined
# again, this can be anywhere in the file
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# each column must be opened by '[COL]' and closed by '[/COL]'
# rules are defined in between


# the following defines a rule to make a column consisting of each (0,1) coefficient
# in a 8x8 dct transformed image

[COL]

# this is the name of the column, which is purely optional
# it is only used if [inc_name] (see above) is set

nam "current"

# this defines the X/Y block size for the transforming DCT
 
bls 8x8

# this defines the step size in x/y direction
# if each block should be included in both directions, use '1/1'
# if, in x direction, only each second block should be included, use '2/1',
# if, in y direction, only each second block should be included, use '1/2' ...

stp 1/1

# this defines, which coeffcient relative to each block in the image should be included
# the 1st ?/? define the relative x/y position of the block to get the coefficient from
# the 2nd ?/? define the absolute u/v position of the coefficient inside the block
# if you want to get the (0,1) coefficient from the current block, use 0/0/0/1

get 0/0/0/1

# if you want to get an average of a range of coefficients use 'til'
# 'til' is optional, but it shouldn't be defined before 'get'

til 0/0/0/1

[/COL]


# the following defines a rule to make a column consisting of each (0,1) coefficient
# of a left side neighbouring block in a 8x8 dct transformed image
